## Alert

_(in progress)_

This model is based on [FIWARE Alert](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Alert/blob/master/Alert/doc/spec.md).

> This entity models an alert and could be used to send alerts related to (…) [specific categories of alerts]. The purpose of the model is to support the generation of notifications for a user or trigger other actions, based on such alerts.
> 
> An alert is generated by a specific situation. The main features of an alert is that it is not predictable and it is not a recurrent data. That means that an alert could be an accident (…).

The required attributes are: `id`, `type`, `category`, `dateIssued`, `alertSource`.
